    "text": "For my senior project, I will be comparing forecasting methods and speeds in order to take advantage of recent performance improvements in the data warehouse at my place of employment. Though I won’t be able to share details, I will post tips and tricks for the packages I will be using and will share useful advice I learn about time series characteristics such as trends and seasonality, statistical concepts like autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation, and methods like ETS, TBATS, and ARIMA.\nSome of the packages I plan to use:\n\nForecast: A well known package for forecasting with time series. See: Automatic Time Series Forecasting: The forecast Package for R\nFable: Essentially version three of the Forecast package, but renamed as it now works with tsibbles. See: Fable\nFKF: Fast Kalman Filter. See: The Fast Kalman Filter\nKFAS: Exponential Family State Space Models in R.\nBenchmark: A package for performance comparisons. See: Microbenchmark"

    "text": "The first thing you need to know about the Forecast package is that there is an incredibly helpful text by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos titled Forecasting: Principles and Practice which explains relevant concepts and walks through almost every function with examples. If you would like to work through their examples, you can download the fpp2 package which includes Forecast and all of the data. I wish every package had such a helpful guide.\nSome other useful resources:\n\nThe Forecast package manual and vignette is available here\nHyndsight, Rob J. Hyndman’s blog\nCross Validated, Stack Exchange’s Q&A for Statistical Topics\n\nHyndman pretty actively answers questions both on his blog and on Cross Validated, so I suggest reading the comments if your question isn’t answered in a blog entry.\n\n\n\nWhen they refer to a time series, they are not referring to data with time information. They are referring to a specific data type, the time series.\n\n#install.packages(\"fpp2\")\nlibrary(fpp2)\nhead(Nile)\n\nTime Series:\nStart = 1871 \nEnd = 1876 \nFrequency = 1 \n[1] 1120 1160  963 1210 1160 1160\n\nhead(goog200)\n\nTime Series:\nStart = 1 \nEnd = 6 \nFrequency = 1 \n[1] 392.8300 392.5121 397.3059 398.0113 400.4902 408.0957\n\n\nUnlike a data frame or tibble, there isn’t a column for times, rather a time series has a starting point, an ending point, and a frequency. Typically, a frequency of 1 is annual, 4 is quarterly, 12 is monthly, and so on. The start year for the Nile data is 1871, while the start for the Google daily closing stock price is arbitrary, representing an undated year."
