Though I won't be able to share details, I will post tips and tricks for the packages I will be using and will share useful advice I learn about time series characteristics such as trends and seasonality, statistical concepts like autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation, and methods like ETS, TBATS, and ARIMA. \n\nSome of the packages I plan to use:\n- __Forecast:__ A well known package for forecasting with time series. See: [Automatic Time Series Forecasting: The forecast Package for R](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v027i03)\n- __Fable:__ Essentially version three of the Forecast package, but renamed as it now works with tsibbles. See: [Fable](https://fable.tidyverts.org/index.html)\n- __FKF:__ Fast Kalman Filter. See: [The Fast Kalman Filter](https://waternumbers.github.io/FKF/index.html)\n- __KFAS:__ [Exponential Family State Space Models in R](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v078i10).\n- __Benchmark:__ A package for performance comparisons. See: [Microbenchmark](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/microbenchmark/)\n\n![](thumbnail.jpg)\n\nSince this post doesn't specify an explicit `image`, the first image in the post will be used in the listing page of posts.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../bootstrap.min.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","theme":"lux","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Introducing My Senior Project","author":"Tristan O'Malley","date":"2022-09-16","draft":true,"categories":["senior project"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
